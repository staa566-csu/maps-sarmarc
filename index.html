<p>This graphic shows the primary crop in each Illinois county by acres harvested. I chose a color pallet with distinct colors to make it easy to distinguish the different crop designations for each county. Since a few counties did not have data, I chose to use a black outline on the map; this made it easy to see the county lines while also preventing the states without data (which are white) from blending into a white border. Making the map interactive allowed additional data (acres harvested, county names) to be shown in the tooltip instead of over-crowding the visualization.</p>
